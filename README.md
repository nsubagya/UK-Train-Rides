# UK-Train-Rides
"UK-Train Rides" is my newest Power BI project, offering insights into the UK-based National Rail, which supports passenger train operators across England, Scotland, and Wales. 

As part of the @Maven Analytics Challenge, I developed an exploratory dashboard analyzing train ticket sales, revenue data, public user frequency, and operational performance from December 2023 to April 2024.

Here are the business problems:

- Identify the most popular routes.
- Determine peak travel times.
- Analyze revenue from different ticket types and classes.
- Diagnose on-time performance and contributing factors.

Key Findings:

- **Trips and Revenue:** 19,081 out of 19,871 trips generated £703,219 in total revenue, serving 30.54K public users.
- **Popular Routes:** Manchester Piccadilly to Liverpool Lime Street is the most traveled route with 4,338 public users out of 4,628 sold tickets, while the London Kings Cross to York route generates the highest revenue at £179,498 (before refunds £183,193).
- **Peak Travel Times:** Early mornings at 6 AM and 7 AM and late afternoons from 5 PM to 6 PM are the busiest times.
- **Revenue Analysis:** Standard class tickets generate significantly more revenue than First Class, with Advance tickets in Standard class bringing in £229,373 (before refunds £242,388).
- **Delay Analysis:** Weather conditions and signal failures are the primary causes of delays.
- **On-Time Performance:** Approximately 27K trips, or 92% of successful journeys (and 87% of all bookings), were on time.

Takeaways:
These insights will help improve railway operations, finances, and enhance the passenger experience.

My Recommendations:

- Allocate resources to popular routes by increasing train frequency, sorting out signal failures, and addressing staff shortages (more staff on Wednesdays and Sundays) and capacity.
- Optimize peak travel times by adjusting schedules and deploying additional staff depending on the route profitability.
- Implement new pricing strategies for high-revenue and high-demand routes.
- Improve on-time performance by investing in infrastructure and technology, and discuss how to continue operations in all weather conditions without disruption.
- Improve customer service by implementing new strategies to efficiently manage delays and cancellations..
